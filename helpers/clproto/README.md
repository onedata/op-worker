clproto
=======

*clproto* is a part of *onedata* system that unifies access to files stored at heterogeneous data storage systems 
that belong to geographically distributed organizations.

Goals
-----

The goal of *clproto* is to provide a communication contract between *oneprovider* (self-scalable cluster that
will is a central point of each data centre that uses *onedata*) and *oneclient* (a user space file system that that
frees users from problems related to data access in heterogeneous environments).

Getting Started
---------------

*clproto* is **not** a standalone project. It shouldn't be built separately. It should be build only with 
*oneprovider* or *oneclient*.
