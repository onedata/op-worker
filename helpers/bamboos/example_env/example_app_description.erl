    % First type of response can be static binary. It is returned every time the endpoint is requested.
    % #mock_resp has default values for code, content_type and headers. They can be easily overriden,
    % but in most cases it's enough to specify just the 'body' field.
    % Path can be any binary compatible with cowboy's router syntax:
    % http://ninenines.eu/docs/en/cowboy/HEAD/guide/routing/ - see matching paths.

    % Second type of response can be a list of static responses. They are returned in order of the list.
    % If the end of the list is reached, it starts from the beggining again.

    % Third type are dynamically generated responses. To define such a response, a two argument function must
    % be provided. Args are Req (cowboy req record) and State (custom state of the mapping, passed between requests).
