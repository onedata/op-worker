About
=====

*oneprovider* is a part of *onedata* system that unifies access to files stored at heterogeneous data storage systems 
that belong to geographically distributed organizations.


Goals
-----

The main goal of *oneprovider* is to provision a self-scalable cluster, which manages the *onedata* system in a single
data centre, i.e. it stores meta-data about actual users' data from the data centre, decides how to distribute users'
files among available storage systems, and executes data management rules, which can be defined by administrators or
users.
