Release notes for project op-worker
===================================

CHANGELOG
---------

### 20.02.20

-   **VFS-10540** Ported rtransfer fixes with better error recovery and
    handling from develop to stable branch 20.02.

### 20.02.19

-   **VFS-9926** Web GUI: Opening Oneprovider view in Onezone GUI when
    entering Oneprovider domain.
-   **VFS-9730** Improve handling of api caveats related to API
    operations concerning other components than Onezone - in some cases,
    tokens with such caveats could be treated as invalid.
-   **VFS-10012** Web GUI: Fixed hanging file upload bug when multiple
    uploads have been scheduled.


### 20.02.18

### 20.02.17

-   **VFS-9415** Improved display of sensitive storage config details in
    Onepanel GUI to show censored values instead of hiding them
    completely.

### 20.02.16

-   **VFS-9119** Introduced a temporary fix for uid/gid encoding of
    values outside of signed int32 range - the values are trimmed to the
    value of 2,147,483,646 for displaying in Oneclient. Full support for
    unsigned int32 range (in alignment with POSIX uid\_t and gid\_t
    types) will be introduced in the next major release.
-   **VFS-9118** Import ignores other file types than regular and
    directories (i.e., fifo, symlink).
-   **VFS-8939** Fixed a bug related to path caveats in access tokens,
    where a Oneclient user would see the names of newly created
    files/directories outside of the allowed paths (but was not able to
    access them).
-   **VFS-8828** Fixed conda packages for the stable branch 20.02.\*,
    starting with version 20.02.15 and Python 3.9.

### 20.02.15

### 20.02.14

-   **VFS-8482** Added dedicated page for privacy policy content.

### 20.02.13

-   **VFS-8335** Fix a regression in proxied access to spaces (ones not
    supported by the Oneprovider serving the request) causing false
    ENOENT errors.
-   **VFS-8212** Web GUI: fixed not working current directory rename.


### 20.02.12

### 20.02.11

-   **VFS-8017** Added support for allowing setting of UID and GID in
    the admin context on the POSIX storage to be other than 0:0.

### 20.02.10

-   **VFS-7739** Improved CPU affinity of storage driver threads in
    Oneprovider.

    audit log, which can be optionally enabled in Oneprovider config.

### 20.02.8

-   **VFS-7517** Several bug fixes related to edge-cases when moving or
    deleting files.

### 20.02.7

-   **VFS-7294** Added publicly available REST endpoints for fetching
    information and data of shared files/directories. The data-related
    endpoints are offered by Onezone, which redirects to a suitable
    Oneprovider so that a guest user does not need any knowledge of the
    environment to access the data. Improved the Web GUI's shares view
    to present the public endpoints in an easy-to-use manner.
-   **VFS-7276** Improved handling of startup errors in Oneclient,
    including more graceful handling of various exceptions and more
    informative error messages including Oneclient and Oneprovider
    compatibility and invalid token issues.
-   **VFS-7271** Fixed displaying shared space root directory name in
    GUI.
-   **VFS-7165** Add a workaround for Erlang's SSL implementation that
    would not reload server certificate chain when it is changed (e.g.
    after Let's Encrypt certificate regeneration).
-   **VFS-6566** Improved UX and fixed minor issues in share views.
    Fixed inability to open share hosted by Oneprovider 19.02.x using
    Onezone 20.02.x.
-   **VFS-6289** Add support for ANONYMOUS@ principal to ACL.


### 20.02.6

-   **VFS-7182** Storage name no longer needs to be unique.
-   **VFS-6928** Fixed possible deadlock in massive parallel truncate
    operations on Ceph pools, which could\'ve affected replica eviction
    and delete operations.
-   **VFS-6802** Added visual QoS expression editor with live matching
    storages evaluation.

### 20.02.5

-   **VFS-7129** Improved connection pool management for HTTP storages,

    \--preserve=times\` or \`rsync \--times\` commands.
-   **VFS-7058** Handling detached shares after files or directories
    removal in GUI.

    to storage which fails after the file size has been updated.
-   **VFS-6999** Improve error reporting in entrypoints of
    oneprovider/onezone dockers, always dump application logs to stdout
    in case of failures during batch deployment.

    GUI.

### 20.02.4

-   **VFS-7003** Added new counters presenting progress of current/last
    finished scan of the storage import mechanism - number of all
    processed files (\`Processed files\`) and the total number of files
    residing on the storage during the scan (\`Total storage files\`).
-   **VFS-6958** Added new endpoint that checks correctness of a QoS
    expression and returns the list of storages that match the
    expression.
-   **VFS-6940** Fix truncating of sparse files.
-   **VFS-6891** Added new REST api for file deletion, uploading and
    downloading in both normal mode and share mode, accessible under
    \`/data/{fileId}\` path.
-   **VFS-6841** Introduce unified time management in all Onedata
    components - all clusters now regularly synchronize their clocks
    with the Onezone service, the process is managed by Onepanel's
    master node.
-   **VFS-6687** Blocked file path resolutions for unsupported spaces.


### 20.02.3

-   **VFS-6967** Fixed not visible JSON and RDF metadata editors in GUI
    in Safari.
-   **VFS-6927** Optimize file blocks management to decrease memory
    usage.


### 20.02.2

-   **VFS-6925** Fixed inability to scroll down files list in Firefox on
    macOS using HiDPI display.
-   **VFS-6853** Matching session cookie is now required to verify a GUI
    access tokens (they are used behind the scenes by the Onedata web
    applications), which increases security.
-   **VFS-6851** Fixed a security issue in Oneprovider share GUI.
-   **VFS-6845** Prevent application from stopping until all documents
    are correctly persisted in order to improve resistance to temporary
    database errors.

    available for download.
-   **VFS-6456** Show more details about lack of privileges when trying
    to perform various actions in GUI.
-   **VFS-6338** Enhanced API of the mechanism for importing existing
    data into Onedata spaces without need for copying the data. The
    mechanism is now called "storage import". Introduced modes of
    storage import: "manual" which allows for manual registration of
    files and "auto" which enables automatic detection and import of
    files from the storage. Introduced possibility to forcefully
    start/stop scans of auto storage import. Redesigned GUI related to
    storage import, adjusted to the new features.


### 20.02.1

-   **VFS-6668** Fix bug resulting in timeouts of workers after 30s.
-   **VFS-6645** Optimize changes querrying.
-   **VFS-6628** Extended harvesting configuration - it is now possible
    to select harvesting options, like metadata types to harvest or
    additional file details (fileName, spaceId), upon index creation.
    New metadata types are now harvestable - xattrs and rdf. Default
    values of HarvestingBackendType and HarvestingBackendEndpoint can
    now be set by Onezone admin - if set, these values can be omitted
    when creating a new harvester. New option (retry\_on\_rejection)
    allowing for all payloads rejected by the harvesting backend to be
    automatically analysed for offending data (e.g. fields that do not
    match the schema), pruned and submitted again.
-   **VFS-6580** Fixed bug that could block dbsync on-demand streams on
    multi-node deployments.
-   **VFS-6577** Improve data transfer performance to object storages
    (e.g. S3) by aligning transferred block size to the object size on
    target storage, thus minimizing the overhead necessary when updating
    a file object with partial content.
-   **VFS-6568** Introduced concept of readonly storage. If enabled,
    Oneprovider will block any operation that writes, modifies or
    deletes data on the storage. Such storage can only be used to import
    data into the space. Mandatory to ensure proper behaviour if the
    backend storage is actually configured as readonly.
-   **VFS-6547** Fixed switching between spaces in file browser GUI
    during upload.
-   **VFS-6535** Updated S3 SDK library to 1.8.7.
-   **VFS-6504** Added HTTP storage helper allowing registration of HTTP
    and HTTPS servers as storage sources for Onedata Spaces.
-   **VFS-6494** Introduced REST API for registering files.
-   **VFS-6474** Added initial support for XRootD storage, including
    direct access to XRootD storages and importing of legacy data sets
    stored on XRootD or EOS servers.
-   **VFS-6457** Added new publicly visible field to shares -
    description (supports the markdown format).
-   **VFS-6456** Do not allow the user to perform actions in the GUI
    related to transfers without the appropriate permissions.
-   **VFS-6455** Support for jumping to selected files in GUI, even if
    they are not visible on infinite-scroll list.
-   **VFS-6453** New Open Data and share description views with visual
    Dublin Core editor and Markdown editor.
-   **VFS-6450** Added file name and space id to harvested file
    metadata.
-   **VFS-6431** Added performance logs for object storages, which can
    generate CSV file containing all storage requests including their
    duration.
-   **VFS-6421** New generic GUI plugin for harvesters.
-   **VFS-6378** Onepanel GUI and REST API now explicitly block
    supporting a space with more than one imported storage (globally) -
    such operation was possible in the past but was never supported by
    the internal storage import logic and led to incoherent view on
    space data.
-   **VFS-6370** Create secure fold mechanism on model documents.
-   **VFS-6361** Added new REST api for creating transfers and viewing
    file distribution, accessible respectively under \`/transfers\` and
    \`/data/{fileId}/distribution\` paths. Old \`/replicas\`,
    \`/replicas-id\` and \`/replicas-view\` endpoints were deprecated
    and will be removed in next major release.
-   **VFS-6358** Optimization of files upload through GUI.
-   **VFS-6346** GUI improvements: added Oneprovider GUI notifications,
    better file selection, additional error handling, better file
    manager refresh UX, fixed overflow of context menu in file browser,
    fixes in responsive layout.
-   **VFS-6344** GUI: showing information if QoS requirement is
    impossible to be fulfilled.
-   **VFS-6343** Added delete account feature in GUI.
-   **VFS-6320** Old \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes\`,
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}\`,
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}/reduce\` and
    \`/spaces/{sid}/indexes/{index\_name}/query\` endpoints were
    deprecated and will be removed in next major release.
-   **VFS-6316** Added \`statfs\` support enabling preview of available
    storage in each space through oneclient, for instance using \`df\`
    or \`stat\` utilities.
-   **VFS-6288** Basic HA functionality (experimental) - protect
    Oneprovider from single node failure.
-   **VFS-6287** Integrate traverse pools with HA sub-system.
-   **VFS-6263** New experimental Quality of Service functionality. It
    is used to manage file replica distribution and redundancy between
    supporting Oneproviders. Users can define any number of QoS
    requirements for a file or directory. Each requirement consists of
    target replicas number and an expression that is used to select
    storages where the replicas should be placed ‐ it is matched against
    parameters that were assigned to storages by Oneprovider admins.
-   **VFS-6261** Integrate high-level services with HA sub-system.
-   **VFS-6225** Added new \`triggers\` field to changes stream
    specification allowing to send events only on specified docs types
    changes.
-   **VFS-6184** Added the space owner concept. Space owner works like
    \"root\" within the space - such user is allowed to perform all
    file/API operations, regardless of the assigned privileges and file
    permissions / ACLs. Ownership can be assigned to any number of
    users, and it is forbidden to leave a space without an owner -
    ownership must be transferred first.
-   **VFS-6167** Allow nodes adding and deleting in-fly basing on HA
    sub-system.
-   **VFS-6160** Reorganized Local User Mapping (LUMA) management.
    Introduced feeds for populating LUMA DB.
-   **VFS-6095** Mask private file attributes, such as uid or gid, when
    showing file attrs in share mode.
-   **VFS-5648** Extended QoS expression to allow comparators (\<, \>,
    \<=, \>=) and numeric values. Changed \"-\" operator to \"\\\".
    Space characters (\" \"), dashes (\"-\") and underscores (\"\_\")
    are now allowed in QoS parameters. Added more details to invalid QoS
    expression errors.
-   **VFS-4760** Added implicit API caveats that limit access tokens
    used by Onedata GUIs behind the scenes for authentication and
    authorization. Different services in the system are presented with
    user\'s access token with power limited to bare minimum required for
    the service to handle user requests. For example, Oneproviders do
    not have access to APIs that could alter or delete user data and
    memberships.

    synchronizer blocking by dead providers.
-   **VFS-6631** Rtransfer takes into account storage block size
    choosing blocks to synchronize.
-   **VFS-6607** Fix node restart with HA disabled.

    reporting token related errors - tokens can be used for
    authentication as well as input data for some operations (e.g.
    invite tokens).
-   **VFS-6390** Because of asynchronous processing, it was possible
    that GraphSync session cleanup intertwined with deleted record
    cleanup (that removes corresponding subscriptions from sessions,
    possibly including the session being cleaned up) and caused an error
    that interrupted change propagation. Now, if the session is no
    longer existent, subscription removal errors are ignored and the
    propagation completes.
